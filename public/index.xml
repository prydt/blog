      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently released a video explaining chain replication. You can see it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZPNOIMyVCw
Below is my rough draft script for the video. Enjoy!
[TITLE SLIDE] Hi everyone, my name is Pry and I’ll be explaining Chain Replication.
[PAPER INFO SLIDE] The original paper is by Renesse &amp;amp; Schneider presented at OSDI 2004 so it&amp;rsquo;s exactly 20 years old now.
[MOTIVATION SLIDE] First, let me motivate the problem that chain replication is trying to solve.</description>

      <title>What I Want From a C stdlib</title>

      <description>or what I always end up needing in C
 Hi! I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged in a while but over this summer I plan to change that. I&amp;rsquo;ll just be writing about random things on my mind. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing more C lately so I think I&amp;rsquo;ll do what is a rite of passage for systems programmers: complain about C and rant that my specific needs would be better met with yet another standard library replacement.</description>

      <title>2021 in Review</title>

      <description>2021 was a wild year. Year two of our global pandemic. Like all years in recent memory, so much happened. January 6th, Among Us, Myanmar, Ever Given, Squid Game, NASA&amp;rsquo;s Ingenuity, Dune, James Webb Space Telescope.
For me, it was a year of transition. I spent my entire high school senior year online and was itching to go in person to university knowing all of the risks. Even with all the changes, I had a great time during my first semester at UT and have come to love Austin as a city.</description>

      <title>You Can&#39;t Trust Closed Source Software</title>
      <link>https://blog.prydt.xyz/posts/you-cant-trust-closed-source-sw/</link>

      <description>Open source software, Free software, whatever you want to call it, is often better than its proprietary counterparts when security, privacy, and performance are being considered. The primary downsides of using open source software is that it is often less immediately accessible and the UIs lack polish. (This is why we need more designers, artists, and other non-programmers in the open source world!)
But one benefit of open source software that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen overlooked by many is that open source software is more verifiably private.</description>

      <title>Kotlin for Data Structures Practice</title>
      <link>https://blog.prydt.xyz/posts/kotlin-for-data-structures-practice/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.prydt.xyz/posts/kotlin-for-data-structures-practice/</guid>
      <description>or Why Kotlin? The main difference between a computer scientist and a programmer is similar to the difference between an artist and a painter. A programmer merely writes programs, while a computer scientist creates art. This art is a subjective matter but I do find that each programmer has their own taste and one particular axis by which I measure the beauty of code is whether it uses the right abstractions and whether it is efficient without being sloppy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Complexity Explained</title>

      <description>“Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.”
&amp;ndash; Edsger W. Dijkstra
 Ever wondered what asymptotic complexity or Big-\(\mathcal{O}\) notation are or what they mean mathematically? This post will explain asymptotic complexity without handwaving as much of the math. This post is meant for someone who has heard of Big-O but doesn&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what it means.</description>

      <title>Programming Language Opinions</title>
      <link>https://blog.prydt.xyz/posts/programming-language-opinions/</link>

      <description>Programming languages to hackers are tools and many craftspeople take great pride in their tools of choice. Tools often come with trade offs and the most skilled craftspeople know precisely when to use a tool and perhaps most importantly, when not to.
 Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language expresses the Yin and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the Tao.
But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.</description>

      <title>Our Technology Dystopia and How to Survive in It</title>

      <description>We are living in a dystopia. A dystopia without the neon lights and synth-heavy soundtracks that we are used to seeing in movies but a dystopia that is no less dangerous and despotic. A bold claim, I know, but it is an increasingly accurate and justified description of our world today.</description>
